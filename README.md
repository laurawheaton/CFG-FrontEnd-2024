Project name: Travel Map

Project description: 
The Travel Map is an interactive website designed to enhance travel planning by offering users an engaging way to explore the world. The countries available on the map currently are Bali, Spain, Utah and Thailand. The map allows users to click on pins representing various countries, which then redirects them to information pages specific to each country, providing details about culture and popular attractions.

Features:
- Interactive World Map: Clickable pins on a world map, each representing a different country. When you click, the country name label appears, allowing the user to click through to the information page.
- Country Information Pages: Unique pages for each country with clickable tabs navigating between country description, cuisine, population and places to visit.
- User-Friendly Navigation: Intuitive layout that makes it easy to navigate between the map and information pages.

How to Use
1. Explore the Map: Use the interactive map to hover over different pins representing different countries.
2. Select a Country: Click on a pin to bring up the clickable label of the country name, taking you to that countries information page, or use the 'countries' drop down menu to choose between countries.
3. Navigate Back: Return to the map to explore additional countries by clicking the back button or using a dedicated navigation menu and home button.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Weather API - to get the current weather for each specific country

Future improvements:
- Allow users to save favorite countries or create a travel wishlist.
- Find a way to implement an API of different countries, meaning we can implement a wider range of travel destinations.
